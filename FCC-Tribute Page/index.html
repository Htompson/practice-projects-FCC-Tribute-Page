          <h4 id="topic">Early Life</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Born in London, June 23, 1912</li>
              <li>He had a strong interest in science and could be described as unique, one who challenged authority and went against the grain. </li>
              <li>Attended King's College, Cambridge University and was elected a Fellow of the college in 1935. </li>
              <li>His paper, "On Computable Numbers", helped to define computation and limitations on what it could achieve, much of which is now recognized as the foundation of modern computer science. </li>
              <li>Turing moved to the US and studied at Princeton, returning to Britain in 1938. </li>
            </ul>

          <h4 id="topic">Contributions to Computing & AI</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Turing was recruited into the British communications war. From 1939-1945, he worked on cryptological investigations, including work on the German war machine, Enigma, an encrypted communications device used by the Nazis. </li>
            <li>In 1940, Turing created a computer nicknamed the "Bombe". The Bombe helped to decrypt the code that the Enigma communicated. The Bombe was capable of unravelling messages from the highest levels of German government (including those from Adolf Hitler!)</li>
            <li>Alan created the Turing Test,which was used to determine whether a computer was intelligent or not, making strides to the field of Artificial Intelligence.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>


        <div class="inner_div" id="div3">
          <h4 id="topic">Personal Life & Death</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Turing identified as a homosexual man during a time when homosexual relationships were criminal offences in the UK. He was arrested arrest in February 1952 for a sexual affair. He escaped imprisonment, and was forced to be chemically castrated, injected with experimental feminizing hormones. After this, he was disqualified from continuing secret cryptological work.</li>
            <li>Alan Turing died on June 7, 1954 by cyanide poisoning. His death has been speculated as a suicide or an accidental poisoning. </li>
            <li>In 2009, the British government formally apologised for the persecution and homophobic acts against Turing and recognized his contributions to humankind.</li>
          </ul>
